            As a engineering lead, I transformed an inherited, aging system into something new and fun to work with. The team and I put out some excellent new features along the way as well + a mobile app! Lets talk system design, and developer satisfaction.

            Small teams are where itâ€™s at! We made client-events work. Twitter
            injests a massive amount of event data every second from its
            users. We needed to make that work efficiently on web. Lots of
            react, lots of document writing, lots of good code ( and better
            yet, good times :} ).

            This app did (maybe still does?) it all; live chat, live
            streaming, video calls, scheduling, you name it! Built in React
            Native using firebase as our ~~fire~~ starter. It was a small team
            of four. I acted as the technical founder. Many lessons learned on
            this project that I would love to talk about.

            Software engineer turned product person. I acted as a product
            designer and full-stack engineer. We did it all; integration
            tests, lots of D3, immense amount of performance work (had to
            write the very scary, yet very cool, C++), SSH tunneling, Netconf,
            ~~insert random networking acronym or something~~.
