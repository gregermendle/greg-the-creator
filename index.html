            Typical start up things... Lots of code writing, taking creative
            liberties, putting out fires. I’m taking the initiative to
            transforming the tech-stack a bit and bring things into the now.
            Currently working in vue and react (hopefully only one of them soon)
            with js and typescript.

            Small teams are where it’s at. We made client-events work. Twitter
            injests a massive amount of event data every second from its users.
            We needed to make that work efficiently on web. Lots of react, lots
            of document writing, lots of good code (and better yet, good times
            :).

            This was a passion project. I built a video confrencing, live chat,
            live streaming, you name it, React Native app for coaches. It was a
            small team of four and I was the only dev. Many lessons learned on
            this project that I would love to talk about.

            Software engineer turned product person. There’s honestly so much to
            talk about here. Here are a few words to get us started. Product
            designer, integration tests, lots of D3, immense amount of
            performance work (had to write the very scary, yet very cool, C++),
            SSH stuff, pretty much an entire stack flipturn.
