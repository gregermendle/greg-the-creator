              Typical start-up things... Lots of code writing, some designing,
              more architecting, even more mentoring. As a engineering lead, im
              working on transforming an inherited, aging system into something
              new and fun to work with. Lets talk system design, and developer
              satisfaction.

              Small teams are where itâ€™s at! We made client-events work. Twitter
              injests a massive amount of event data every second from its
              users. We needed to make that work efficiently on web. Lots of
              react, lots of document writing, lots of good code ( and better
              yet, good times :} ).

              This app did (maybe still does?) it all; live chat, live
              streaming, video calls, scheduling, you name it! Built in React
              Native using firebase as our ~~fire~~ starter. It was a small team
              of four. I acted as the technical founder. Many lessons learned on
              this project that I would love to talk about.

              Software engineer turned product person. I acted as a product
              designer and full-stack engineer. We did it all; integration
              tests, lots of D3, immense amount of performance work (had to
              write the very scary, yet very cool, C++), SSH tunneling, Netconf,
              ~~insert random networking acronym or something~~.
